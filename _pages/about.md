Dr. Changzhi Li received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, in 2009. He is a Professor at Texas Tech University. His research interest is microwave/millimeter-wave sensing for healthcare, security, energy efficiency, structural monitoring, and human-machine interface.

Dr. Li is the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) Distinguished Microwave Lecturer, Tatsuo Itoh class of 2022-2024. He was a recipient of the IEEE MTT-S Outstanding Young Engineer Award, the IEEE Sensors Council Early Career Technical Achievement Award, the ASEE Frederick Emmons Terman Award, the IEEE-HKN Outstanding Young Professional Award, the NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award, and the IEEE MTT-S Graduate Fellowship Award. He is an Associate Editor of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES and the IEEE JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETICS, RF AND MICROWAVES IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY.
